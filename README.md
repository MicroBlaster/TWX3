## What is TWX3?

**TWX Proxy 3** is a [TradeWars 2002 (TW2002)](http://www.eisonline.com) helper ported from Deplhi to C# by Microblaster and Shadow.

Originally written by Remco Mulder, [TWXProxy](https://github.com/erikh/twxproxy) has been passed on to various developers over the years. We are proud you finally bring this to a modern platform so that development can continue.
